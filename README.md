# web_scraper
Web Scraper using Selenium and Beautiful Soup


This is a simple webscrapper for collecting data on a local classifiedl website for vehicles (riyasewana.com). I was looking for a classic japanes bike on the market and too lazy to browse one by one. So I came up with the solution. Currently this code only prints the details on the first page only. I will keep on continue to modify the code to search the entire website and make inputs more custom. Please use this as a learning tool not to do any illegal activities. Always follow the ethics of web.

Cheers!!!
